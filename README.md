fanciful
========
Lightweight library offering pleasant chat message formatting for Bukkit plugins. A way to get at the good stuff offered by Minecraft 1.7's new chat protocol without dropping down to raw JSON.

Installation
--------
Eventually, it'll be available as a Maven dependency. Right now you'll have to drop the .java files into place by hand. You probably shouldn't use this yet.

Usage
--------
See [Example.java](http://github.com/mkremins/fanciful/tree/master/src/example/java/mkremins/fanciful/Example.java) for a simple example.

Status
--------
Super-duper WIP. Fortunately, Bukkit 1.7.x is no more ready for release than this is, so I've got some time.

--------
